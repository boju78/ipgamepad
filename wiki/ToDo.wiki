#summary List of things that need to be implemented

= To-Do List =

1. Set GPS waypoints/autonomous mode (giant kill button and constantly sends "alive" packet)<br />
2. Toggle Switch View<br />
3. Push buttons<br />
4. "Turbo" mode, so you can increase sensitivity for lower speeds - will be handy for robot demos where you don't want the robot shooting off at high velocity
